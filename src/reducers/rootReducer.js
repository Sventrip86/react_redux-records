      {id: '1', title: 'George Harrison, ‘All Things Must Pass’ ', body: 'Harrison had almost enough songs stored up from his Beatles days for a triple LP – the gas starts to run out during the jams on Side Six. But spiritual guitar quests like "My Sweet Lord" and "What Is Life" became classics.'},
      {id: '2', title: 'Brian Eno, ‘Here Come The Warm Jets’', body: 'Eno s first solo album pioneered a new kind of glammy art rock: jagged, free-form and dreamy. -Baby s on Fire- and -Needles in the Camel s Eye- are vicious rockers with detached vocals, and Robert Fripp s warped guitars swarm and stutter.'},
      {id: '3', title: 'The Doors, ‘Strange Days’', body: 'The Doors set out into darker territory on their second album. The catchy single "Love Me Two Times" is overshadowed by a mood of foreboding and alienation, especially on "People Are Strange" and "When the Music s Over," which demands, "We want the world, and we want it now!"'}
